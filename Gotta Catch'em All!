Nothing interesting came up. After that i run gobuster for finding any interesting directories

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.184.168 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 

Meanwhile i visit the website since port 80 it's open. Apache manual was opened. 

Looking at the source code at the end there was:

<pokemon>:<hack_the_pokemon>
        	<!--(Check console for extra surprise!)-->
          
Checking the console nothing was found expect the pokemons in order. The phrase "<pokemon>:<hack_the_pokemon>" looked pretty interesting since it was like a "user:password" structure.

Trying ssh with those "credentials" we logged in.

We find a zip file with name "Pokemon.zip" in which is our first flag.

Then we seach every directory if we find anything uncommon.

In the /videos there is another directory called /Gotta which keeps going /Gotta/Catch/Them/All! where is a c++ file with content:
# include <iostream>

int main() {
        std::cout << "ash : pikapika"
        return 0;

Looks like we find other credentials: "ash : pikapika"
we ssh like ash

i upgrade my shell "python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

Looking at the hint that the box gives us for the second flag says "Maybe the website has something interesting."

/var/www/html we find another flag which encrypted in rot14


Root
For the last flag. we need to get root access

we search for any SUID files.
find . -perm /4000 2>/dev/null

and we find the /bin/su

after looking at GTFO bins for the su command, we find that using "sudo su" we get root.

the last flag is in /etc/why_am_i_here?/ encoded in bas64

echo $encrypted_text | base64 -d
